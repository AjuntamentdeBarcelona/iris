    Exchange an OAuth2 access token for one for this site.
    This simply defers the entire OAuth2 process to the front end.
    The front end becomes responsible for handling the entirety of the
    OAuth2 process; we just step in at the end and use the access token
    to populate some user identity.
    The URL at which this view lives must include a backend field, like:
        url(API_ROOT + r'social/(?P<backend>[^/]+)/$', exchange_token),
    Using that example, you could call this endpoint using i.e.
        POST API_ROOT + 'social/facebook/'
        POST API_ROOT + 'social/google-oauth2/'
    Note that those endpoint examples are verbatim according to the
    PSA backends which we configured in settings.py. If you wish to enable
    other social authentication backends, they'll get their own endpoints
    automatically according to PSA.
    ## Request format
    Requests must include the following field
    - `access_token`: The OAuth2 access token provided by the provider
