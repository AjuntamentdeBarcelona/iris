# IRIS2 Public API

In order to meet the security requirements and reduce the involuntary exposure of information, 
the public API of IRIS2 is implemented as totally separated package. "Public" means that can
be used in any point outside the corporate VPN and without passing by any corporative auth system 
like SSO or similar.
